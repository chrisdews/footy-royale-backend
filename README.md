Footy Royale

A battle royale fantasy football game. 

Competing against other managers, predict game results in the English Premier League. You can only pick each team once so choose carefully. If your team doesn’t win that weekend, you are eliminated. Survivors proceed to the next round each week until 1 worthy champion remains.
